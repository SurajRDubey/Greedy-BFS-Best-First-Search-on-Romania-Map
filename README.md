# Greedy-BFS-Best-First-Search-on-Romania-Map
Greedy Algorithm BFS on Romania Map in Java

Best First Search falls under the category of Heuristic Search or Informed Search so as a heuristic I have included 
Priority Queue.
We use a priority queue to store costs of nodes.
So the implementation is a variation of BFS, we just need to change Queue to PriorityQueue.

Coordinates for priority queue have been hardcoded and by default the code runs Greedy BFS from Arad to Bucharest(0 to 11)
Make changes in the source and destination as per your convinience or make it user definable.
